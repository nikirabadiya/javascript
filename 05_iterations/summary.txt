● for loop:
  Used for mostly strings and arrays or incrementable things

● forof loop:
  Mostly used to run loops for the ARRAYS

● forin loop:
  Mostly used to run loops for the OBJECTS

● Map:
  Is iterable with forof loop BUT not with forin loop

● foreach:
  The most used loop as it can be used to run loops for any datatypes, BUT it does not return the values explicitily

● filter:
  It will of cource run a loop like a foreach loop, but will return values on the true or false conditions

● map:
  It will run a loop similarly as foreach method unlike this method will return the value 

● reduce:
  It will also run a loop like foreach but it will help us to do some maths like we do in the shopping card (Please refer the program in the js file)
